I have tried to make it is easy for you to install and test this project, but it will not be as easy as installing Drupal.

Before you start, check out the [list of issues](https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-drupal/issues). None of these issues should get in the way of you testing Symfony Drupal.

{% highlight bash %}
composer create-project bangpound/symfony-drupal symfony-drupal 2.4.x-dev
{% endhighlight %}

Composer will download the Symfony Drupal project and its dependencies, and it may take a few minutes. Finally, Symfony will ask for configuration parameters, including database connection details. (These connection details are not used for Drupal's database connection [yet](https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-drupal/issues/7).)

## Install Drupal

You cannot use install.php to set up Symfony Drupal, but you can use [a slightly modified version of drush](https://github.com/bangpound/drush/compare) to install your site. This modified version of Drush is installed inside the Symfony Drupal project folder's `bin` directory and has only been tested for installing a Drupal site with a database.

{% highlight bash %}
cd symfony-drupal
./bin/drush -r $PWD/web si --db-url=mysql://root@localhost/test --account-pass=symfony
{% endhighlight %}

I had trouble with sqlite, but MySQL works fine. Substitute your desired database name, of course. See the documentation at `./bin/drush help site-install` for details about specifying your preferred options.

## Install Symfony integration module

You will need to download and install the [Symfony module](https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-module) and install it in `vendor/drupal/drupal/sites/all/modules`. You can enable it after you log in to the Drupal site. Without the module, you will not be able to log out of Drupal.

These commands will download and enable the module, but they produce fatal errors with the message "Call to a member function log() on a non-object" that are harmless. The commands succeed.

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-module.git web/sites/all/modules/symfony
./bin/drush -r $PWD/web en symfony
{% endhighlight %}

## Run Symfony Drupal

Then you can use Symfony's console to run the site locally.

{% highlight bash %}
./app/console server:run -v
{% endhighlight %}

Good luck! [Please let me know how it goes!](https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-drupal/issues)
