<p class="lead">I have tried to make it is easy for you to install and test this project, but it will not be as easy as installing Drupal. However, if you develop Drupal sites in a local development environment, it should be simple work for you.</p>

Before you start, review the [list of issues](https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-drupal/issues). None of these issues will get in the way of you testing Symfony Drupal's basic functionality.

## Requirements

I recommend at least **PHP 5.4** for the built-in web server. Probably Symfony Drupal runs on PHP 5.3, but I would not be surprised if I used [PHP 5.4's short array syntax somewhere](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php).

You must have [**Composer**](http://getcomposer.org) installed. On my Mac, I used homebrew: `brew install composer --HEAD`. If you use the method described in the Composer documentation, you may end up with a file named `composer.phar` in which case you might need to substitute `php composer.phar` instead of `composer` in the commands below.

## Download Symfony Drupal and its dependencies

To start, run this command in your shell. It will create a new directory named `symfony-drupal` in the current working directory. On my Mac, I ran this command in `~/Sites`.

{% highlight bash %}
composer create-project bangpound/symfony-drupal symfony-drupal 2.4.x-dev
{% endhighlight %}

Composer will download the Symfony Drupal project and its dependencies, and it may take a few minutes. When it's finished, Composer will ask for configuration parameters on behalf of Symfony, including database connection details. (These connection details are not used for Drupal's database connection [yet](https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-drupal/issues/7), so you can accept the default values for every parameter.)

## Install Drupal

You cannot use install.php to set up Symfony Drupal, but you can use [a slightly modified version of drush](https://github.com/bangpound/drush/compare) to install your site. This modified version of Drush is already installed inside the Symfony Drupal project folder's `bin` directory and has only been tested for installing a Drupal site with a database and downloading Drupal modules and themes.

{% highlight bash %}
cd symfony-drupal
./bin/drush -r $PWD/web si --db-url=mysql://root@localhost/test --account-pass=symfony
{% endhighlight %}

I had trouble with sqlite, but MySQL works fine. Substitute your desired database name and credentials, of course. See the documentation at `./bin/drush help site-install` for details about specifying your preferred options.

## Install Symfony integration module

You will need to download and install the [Symfony module](https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-module). Without this module, you will not be able to log out of Drupal without deleting the session cookie.

These commands will download and enable the module, but they also produce fatal errors with the message "Call to a member function log() on a non-object." **These errors are harmless. The commands succeed.**

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-module.git web/sites/all/modules/symfony
./bin/drush -r $PWD/web en symfony
{% endhighlight %}

## Run Symfony Drupal

Finally you can use Symfony's console to run the site locally if you run PHP 5.4 or greater.

{% highlight bash %}
./app/console server:run -v
{% endhighlight %}

If you are not using PHP 5.4 or greater, thenâ€¦ do whatever you need to do.

Use the username "admin" and password "symfony" to log in as user 1.

## Installing and enabling modules

Whenever you download a module, such as Views, Ctools or Panels, you must also update the autoloader. This is because [I have removed the Drupal registry]({{ site.baseurl }}/how/drupal-7-barriers/). **If you fail to do this, PHP will complain that it cannot find the contrib modules' PHP classes!**

{% highlight bash %}
./bin/drush -r $PWD/web dl ctools views panels
composer dump-autoload -d web/sites/all/
./bin/drush -r $PWD/web en ctools views panels
{% endhighlight %}

After enabling modules, you must also clear the Symfony cache. Otherwise Drupal routes are not registered in Symfony. **If you do not clear the Symfony cache, you will see 404 Page not found errors when you try to navigate to the new modules' pages.**

{% highlight bash %}
./app/console cache:clear
{% endhighlight %}

## Good luck!

Thanks for taking the time to play with Symfony Drupal. [Please let me know how it goes!](https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-drupal/issues)
