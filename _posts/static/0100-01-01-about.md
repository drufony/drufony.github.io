Symfony Drupal is made of four different projects developed during a few weekends and holidays in October and December 2013.

* [A fork of Drupal 7](https://github.com/bangpound/drupal) with three branches that reflect the increasing divergence from the original Drupal 7 code base.
* [A Symfony bundle](https://github.com/bangpound/drupal-bundle) which integrates the Drupal fork into the Symfony framework.
* [A Symfony project template](https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-drupal) which provides a standard Symfony project filesystem structure and which requires the fork and the bundle.
* [A Drupal module](https://github.com/bangpound/symfony-module) which provides Drupal with access to some Symfony services as replacements for Drupal's original functionality.

## The fork has three branches

As [explained elsewhere]({{ site.baseurl }}/how/drupal-7-barriers), the Drupal fork is branched three times.

[`7.x-pimple`](https://github.com/bangpound/drupal/compare/7.x...7.x-pimple) replaces just the Drupal bootstrap with an extensible Pimple container. From my testing, it is a drop-in replacement for Drupal core with no side effects.

[`7.x-autoload`](https://github.com/bangpound/drupal/compare/7.x-pimple...7.x-autoload) replaces the Drupal 7 class registry with Composer autoloading. This is not a drop-in replacement for Drupal core, but it demonstrates how you can subclass the Pimple container to alter Drupal's bootstrap routines.

[`7.x-symfony`](https://github.com/bangpound/drupal/compare/7.x-autoload...7.x-symfony) contains all of the changes required to make Drupal 7 function inside Symfony. The changes from core are minimal.

Overall, [the differences between Drupal 7 and my Symfony fork](https://github.com/bangpound/drupal/compare/7.x...7.x-symfony) are relatively small. As of 27 December 2013, there are 324 additions and 99 deletions in 21 files.
